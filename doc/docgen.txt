Introduction
============

This document describes the `documentation generation tools`:idx: built into
the `Nimrod compiler <nimrodc.html>`_, which can generate HTML and JSON output
from input .nim files and projects, as well as HTML and LaTeX from input RST
(reStructuredText) files. The output documentation will include module
dependencies (``import``), any top-level documentation comments (##), and
exported symbols (*), including procedures, types, and variables.


Documentation Comments
----------------------

Any comments which are preceded by a double-hash (##), are interpreted as
documentation.  Comments are parsed as RST (see `reference
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_), providing
Nimrod module authors the ability to easily generate richly formatted
documentation with only their well-documented code.

Example:

.. code-block:: nimrod
  type TPerson* = object
    ## This type contains a description of a person
    name: string
    age: int

Outputs::
  TPerson* = object
    name: string
    age: int

This type contains a description of a person

Field documentation comments can be added to fields like so:

.. code-block:: nimrod
  var numValues: int ## \
    ## `numValues` stores the number of values

Note that without the `*` following the name of the type, the documentation for
this type would not be generated. Documentation will only be generated for
*exported* types/procedures/etc.


Nimrod file input
-----------------

The following examples will generate documentation for the below contrived
*Nimrod* module, aptly named 'sample.nim'

sample.nim:

.. code-block:: nimrod
  ## This module is a sample.

  import strutils

  proc helloWorld*(times: int) =
    ## Takes an integer and outputs
    ## as many "hello world!"s

    for i in 0 .. times-1:
      echo "hello world!"

  helloWorld(5)


Document Types
==============


HTML
----

Generation of HTML documents is done via both the ``doc`` and ``doc2``
commands. These command take either a single .nim file, outputting a single
.html file with the same base filename, or multiple .nim files, outputting
multiple .html files and, optionally, an index file.

The ``doc`` command::
  nimrod doc sample

Partial Output::
  ...
  proc helloWorld*(times: int)
  ...

Output can be viewed in full here: `docgen_sample.html <docgen_sample.html>`_.
The next command, called ``doc2``, is very similar to the ``doc`` command, but
will be run after the compiler performs semantic checking on the input nimrod
module(s), which allows it to process macros.

The ``doc2`` command::
  nimrod doc2 sample

Partial Output::
  ...
  proc helloWorld(times: int) {.raises: [], tags: [].}
  ...

The full output can be seen here: `docgen_sample2.html <docgen_sample2.html>`_.
As you can see, the tool has extracted additional information provided to it by
the compiler beyond what the ``doc`` command provides, such as pragmas attached
implicitly by the compiler. This type of information is not available from
looking at the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) prior to semantic checking, as the
``doc`` command does.


JSON
----

Generation of JSON documents is done via the ``jsondoc`` command. This command
takes in a .nim file, and outputs a .json file with the same base filename.
Note that this tool is built off of the ``doc`` command, and therefore is
performed before semantic checking.

The ``jsondoc`` command::
  nimrod jsondoc sample

Output::
  [
    {
      "comment": "This module is a sample."
    },
    {
      "name": "helloWorld",
      "type": "skProc",
      "description": "Takes an integer and outputs as many &quot;hello world!&quot;s",
      "code": "proc helloWorld*(times: int)"
    }
  ]


Related Options
===============

Project switch
--------------

::
  nimrod doc2 --project filename.nim

This will recursively generate documentation of all nimrod modules imported
into the input module, including system modules. Be careful with this command,
as it may end up sprinkling html files all over your filesystem!


Index switch
------------

::
  nimrod doc2 --index:on filename.nim

This will generate an index of all the exported symbols in the input Nimrod
module, and put it into a neighboring file with the extension of `.idx`. The
index file is line oriented (newlines have to be escaped). Each line represents
a tab separated record of several columns, the first two mandatory, the rest
optional:

1. Mandatory term being indexed. Terms can include quoting according to
   Nimrod's rules (eg. ```^```)
2. Base filename plus anchor hyper link (eg.
   ``algorithm.html#*,int,TSortOrder``).
3. Optional human readable string to display as hyper link. If the value is not
   present or is the empty string, the hyper link will be rendered using the
   term.
4. Optional title or description of the hyper link. Browsers usually display
   this as a tooltip after hovering a moment over the hyper link.

Once index files have been generated for one or more modules, the Nimrod
compiler command ``buildIndex directory`` can be run to go over all the index
files in the specified directory to generate a `theindex.html <theindex.html>`_
file.


Other Input Formats
===================

The *Nimrod compiler* also has support for RST (reStructuredText) files with
the ``rst2html`` and ``rst2tex`` commands. Documents like this one are
initially written in a dialect of RST which adds support for nimrod sourcecode
highlighting with the ``.. code-block:: nimrod`` prefix. ``code-block`` also
supports highlighting of C++ and some other c-like languages.

Usage::
  nimrod rst2html docgen.txt

Output::
  You're reading it!

The input can be viewed here `docgen.txt <docgen.txt>`_. The ``rst2tex``
command is invoked identically to ``rst2html``, but outputs a .tex file instead
of .html.
