Pragmas
=======

Pragmas are Nim's method to give the compiler additional information /
commands without introducing a massive number of new keywords. Pragmas are
processed on the fly during semantic checking. Pragmas are enclosed in the
special ``{.`` and ``.}`` curly brackets. Pragmas are also often used as a
first implementation to play with a language feature before a nicer syntax
to access the feature becomes available.


deprecated pragma
-----------------

The deprecated pragma is used to mark a symbol as deprecated:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc p() {.deprecated.}
  var x {.deprecated.}: char

It can also be used as a statement, in that case it takes a list of *renamings*.

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    File = object
    Stream = ref object
  {.deprecated: [TFile: File, PStream: Stream].}

The ``nimfix`` tool can be used to, without effort, automatically update your
code and refactor it by performing these renamings.


noSideEffect pragma
-------------------
The ``noSideEffect`` pragma is used to mark a proc/iterator to have no side
effects. This means that the proc/iterator only changes locations that are
reachable from its parameters and the return value only depends on the
arguments. If none of its parameters have the type ``var T``
or ``ref T`` or ``ptr T`` this means no locations are modified. It is a static
error to mark a proc/iterator to have no side effect if the compiler cannot
verify this.

As a special semantic rule, the built-in `debugEcho <system.html#debugEcho>`_
pretends to be free of side effects, so that it can be used for debugging
routines marked as ``noSideEffect``.

**Future directions**: ``func`` may become a keyword and syntactic sugar for a
proc with no side effects:

.. code-block:: nim
  func `+` (x, y: int): int


destructor pragma
-----------------

The ``destructor`` pragma is used to mark a proc to act as a type destructor.
Its usage is deprecated, see `type bound operations`_ instead.

override pragma
---------------

See `type bound operations`_ instead.

procvar pragma
--------------
The ``procvar`` pragma is used to mark a proc that it can be passed to a
procedural variable.


compileTime pragma
------------------
The ``compileTime`` pragma is used to mark a proc or variable to be used at
compile time only. No code will be generated for it. Compile time procs are
useful as helpers for macros. Since version 0.12.0 of the language, a proc
that uses ``system.NimNode`` within its parameter types is implictly declared
``compileTime``:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc astHelper(n: NimNode): NimNode =
    result = n

Is the same as:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc astHelper(n: NimNode): NimNode {.compileTime.} =
    result = n


noReturn pragma
---------------
The ``noreturn`` pragma is used to mark a proc that never returns.


acyclic pragma
--------------
The ``acyclic`` pragma can be used for object types to mark them as acyclic
even though they seem to be cyclic. This is an **optimization** for the garbage
collector to not consider objects of this type as part of a cycle:

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    Node = ref NodeObj
    NodeObj {.acyclic, final.} = object
      left, right: Node
      data: string

In the example a tree structure is declared with the ``Node`` type. Note that
the type definition is recursive and the GC has to assume that objects of
this type may form a cyclic graph. The ``acyclic`` pragma passes the
information that this cannot happen to the GC. If the programmer uses the
``acyclic`` pragma for data types that are in reality cyclic, the GC may leak
memory, but nothing worse happens.

**Future directions**: The ``acyclic`` pragma may become a property of a
``ref`` type:

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    Node = acyclic ref NodeObj
    NodeObj = object
      left, right: Node
      data: string


final pragma
------------
The ``final`` pragma can be used for an object type to specify that it
cannot be inherited from.


shallow pragma
--------------
The ``shallow`` pragma affects the semantics of a type: The compiler is
allowed to make a shallow copy. This can cause serious semantic issues and
break memory safety! However, it can speed up assignments considerably,
because the semantics of Nim require deep copying of sequences and strings.
This can be expensive, especially if sequences are used to build a tree
structure:

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    NodeKind = enum nkLeaf, nkInner
    Node {.final, shallow.} = object
      case kind: NodeKind
      of nkLeaf:
        strVal: string
      of nkInner:
        children: seq[Node]


pure pragma
-----------
An object type can be marked with the ``pure`` pragma so that its type
field which is used for runtime type identification is omitted. This used to be
necessary for binary compatibility with other compiled languages.

An enum type can be marked as ``pure``. Then access of its fields always
requires full qualification.


asmNoStackFrame pragma
----------------------
A proc can be marked with the ``AsmNoStackFrame`` pragma to tell the compiler
it should not generate a stack frame for the proc. There are also no exit
statements like ``return result;`` generated and the generated C function is
declared as ``__declspec(naked)`` or ``__attribute__((naked))`` (depending on
the used C compiler).

**Note**: This pragma should only be used by procs which consist solely of
assembler statements.

error pragma
------------
The ``error`` pragma is used to make the compiler output an error message
with the given content. Compilation does not necessarily abort after an error
though.

The ``error`` pragma can also be used to
annotate a symbol (like an iterator or proc). The *usage* of the symbol then
triggers a compile-time error. This is especially useful to rule out that some
operation is valid due to overloading and type conversions:

.. code-block:: nim
  ## check that underlying int values are compared and not the pointers:
  proc `==`(x, y: ptr int): bool {.error.}


fatal pragma
------------
The ``fatal`` pragma is used to make the compiler output an error message
with the given content. In contrast to the ``error`` pragma, compilation
is guaranteed to be aborted by this pragma. Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  when not defined(objc):
    {.fatal: "Compile this program with the objc command!".}

warning pragma
--------------
The ``warning`` pragma is used to make the compiler output a warning message
with the given content. Compilation continues after the warning.

hint pragma
-----------
The ``hint`` pragma is used to make the compiler output a hint message with
the given content. Compilation continues after the hint.

line pragma
-----------
The ``line`` pragma can be used to affect line information of the annotated
statement as seen in stack backtraces:

.. code-block:: nim

  template myassert*(cond: expr, msg = "") =
    if not cond:
      # change run-time line information of the 'raise' statement:
      {.line: InstantiationInfo().}:
        raise newException(EAssertionFailed, msg)

If the ``line`` pragma is used with a parameter, the parameter needs be a
``tuple[filename: string, line: int]``. If it is used without a parameter,
``system.InstantiationInfo()`` is used.


linearScanEnd pragma
--------------------
The ``linearScanEnd`` pragma can be used to tell the compiler how to
compile a Nim `case`:idx: statement. Syntactically it has to be used as a
statement:

.. code-block:: nim
  case myInt
  of 0:
    echo "most common case"
  of 1:
    {.linearScanEnd.}
    echo "second most common case"
  of 2: echo "unlikely: use branch table"
  else: echo "unlikely too: use branch table for ", myInt

In the example, the case branches ``0`` and ``1`` are much more common than
the other cases. Therefore the generated assembler code should test for these
values first, so that the CPU's branch predictor has a good chance to succeed
(avoiding an expensive CPU pipeline stall). The other cases might be put into a
jump table for O(1) overhead, but at the cost of a (very likely) pipeline
stall.

The ``linearScanEnd`` pragma should be put into the last branch that should be
tested against via linear scanning. If put into the last branch of the
whole ``case`` statement, the whole ``case`` statement uses linear scanning.


computedGoto pragma
-------------------
The ``computedGoto`` pragma can be used to tell the compiler how to
compile a Nim `case`:idx: in a ``while true`` statement.
Syntactically it has to be used as a statement inside the loop:

.. code-block:: nim

  type
    MyEnum = enum
      enumA, enumB, enumC, enumD, enumE

  proc vm() =
    var instructions: array [0..100, MyEnum]
    instructions[2] = enumC
    instructions[3] = enumD
    instructions[4] = enumA
    instructions[5] = enumD
    instructions[6] = enumC
    instructions[7] = enumA
    instructions[8] = enumB

    instructions[12] = enumE
    var pc = 0
    while true:
      {.computedGoto.}
      let instr = instructions[pc]
      case instr
      of enumA:
        echo "yeah A"
      of enumC, enumD:
        echo "yeah CD"
      of enumB:
        echo "yeah B"
      of enumE:
        break
      inc(pc)

  vm()

As the example shows ``computedGoto`` is mostly useful for interpreters. If
the underlying backend (C compiler) does not support the computed goto
extension the pragma is simply ignored.


unroll pragma
-------------
The ``unroll`` pragma can be used to tell the compiler that it should unroll
a `for`:idx: or `while`:idx: loop for runtime efficiency:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc searchChar(s: string, c: char): int =
    for i in 0 .. s.high:
      {.unroll: 4.}
      if s[i] == c: return i
    result = -1

In the above example, the search loop is unrolled by a factor 4. The unroll
factor can be left out too; the compiler then chooses an appropriate unroll
factor.

**Note**: Currently the compiler recognizes but ignores this pragma.


immediate pragma
----------------

See `Ordinary vs immediate templates`_.


compilation option pragmas
--------------------------
The listed pragmas here can be used to override the code generation options
for a proc/method/converter.

The implementation currently provides the following possible options (various
others may be added later).

===============  ===============  ============================================
pragma           allowed values   description
===============  ===============  ============================================
checks           on|off           Turns the code generation for all runtime
                                  checks on or off.
boundChecks      on|off           Turns the code generation for array bound
                                  checks on or off.
overflowChecks   on|off           Turns the code generation for over- or
                                  underflow checks on or off.
nilChecks        on|off           Turns the code generation for nil pointer
                                  checks on or off.
assertions       on|off           Turns the code generation for assertions
                                  on or off.
warnings         on|off           Turns the warning messages of the compiler
                                  on or off.
hints            on|off           Turns the hint messages of the compiler
                                  on or off.

                                  disable optimization.
patterns         on|off           Turns the term rewriting templates/macros
                                  on or off.
callconv         cdecl|...        Specifies the default calling convention for
                                  all procedures (and procedure types) that
                                  follow.
===============  ===============  ============================================

Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  {.checks: off, optimization: speed.}
  # compile without runtime checks and optimize for speed


push and pop pragmas
--------------------
The `push/pop`:idx: pragmas are very similar to the option directive,
but are used to override the settings temporarily. Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  {.push checks: off.}
  # compile this section without runtime checks as it is
  # speed critical
  # ... some code ...
  {.pop.} # restore old settings


register pragma
---------------
The ``register`` pragma is for variables only. It declares the variable as
``register``, giving the compiler a hint that the variable should be placed
in a hardware register for faster access. C compilers usually ignore this
though and for good reasons: Often they do a better job without it anyway.

In highly specific cases (a dispatch loop of a bytecode interpreter for
example) it may provide benefits, though.


global pragma
-------------
The ``global`` pragma can be applied to a variable within a proc to instruct
the compiler to store it in a global location and initialize it once at program
startup.

.. code-block:: nim
  proc isHexNumber(s: string): bool =
    var pattern {.global.} = re"[0-9a-fA-F]+"
    result = s.match(pattern)

When used within a generic proc, a separate unique global variable will be
created for each instantiation of the proc. The order of initialization of
the created global variables within a module is not defined, but all of them
will be initialized after any top-level variables in their originating module
and before any variable in a module that imports it.

deadCodeElim pragma
-------------------
The ``deadCodeElim`` pragma only applies to whole modules: It tells the
compiler to activate (or deactivate) dead code elimination for the module the
pragma appears in.

The ``--deadCodeElim:on`` command line switch has the same effect as marking
every module with ``{.deadCodeElim:on}``. However, for some modules such as
the GTK wrapper it makes sense to *always* turn on dead code elimination -
no matter if it is globally active or not.

Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  {.deadCodeElim: on.}


..
  NoForward pragma
  ----------------
  The ``noforward`` pragma can be used to turn on and off a special compilation
  mode that to large extent eliminates the need for forward declarations. In this
  mode, the proc definitions may appear out of order and the compiler will postpone
  their semantic analysis and compilation until it actually needs to generate code
  using the definitions. In this regard, this mode is similar to the modus operandi
  of dynamic scripting languages, where the function calls are not resolved until
  the code is executed. Here is the detailed algorithm taken by the compiler:

  1. When a callable symbol is first encountered, the compiler will only note the
  symbol callable name and it will add it to the appropriate overload set in the
  current scope. At this step, it won't try to resolve any of the type expressions
  used in the signature of the symbol (so they can refer to other not yet defined
  symbols).

  2. When a top level call is encountered (usually at the very end of the module),
  the compiler will try to determine the actual types of all of the symbols in the
  matching overload set. This is a potentially recursive process as the signatures
  of the symbols may include other call expressions, whose types will be resolved
  at this point too.

  3. Finally, after the best overload is picked, the compiler will start
  compiling the body of the respective symbol. This in turn will lead the
  compiler to discover more call expressions that need to be resolved and steps
  2 and 3 will be repeated as necessary.

  Please note that if a callable symbol is never used in this scenario, its body
  will never be compiled. This is the default behavior leading to best compilation
  times, but if exhaustive compilation of all definitions is required, using
  ``nim check`` provides this option as well.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: nim

    {.noforward: on.}

    proc foo(x: int) =
      bar x

    proc bar(x: int) =
      echo x

    foo(10)


pragma pragma
-------------

The ``pragma`` pragma can be used to declare user defined pragmas. This is
useful because Nim's templates and macros do not affect pragmas. User
defined pragmas are in a different module-wide scope than all other symbols.
They cannot be imported from a module.

Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  when appType == "lib":
    {.pragma: rtl, exportc, dynlib, cdecl.}
  else:
    {.pragma: rtl, importc, dynlib: "client.dll", cdecl.}

  proc p*(a, b: int): int {.rtl.} =
    result = a+b

In the example a new pragma named ``rtl`` is introduced that either imports
a symbol from a dynamic library or exports the symbol for dynamic library
generation.


Disabling certain messages
--------------------------
Nim generates some warnings and hints ("line too long") that may annoy the
user. A mechanism for disabling certain messages is provided: Each hint
and warning message contains a symbol in brackets. This is the message's
identifier that can be used to enable or disable it:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.hint[LineTooLong]: off.} # turn off the hint about too long lines

This is often better than disabling all warnings at once.


experimental pragma
-------------------

The ``experimental`` pragma enables experimental language features. Depending
on the concrete feature this means that the feature is either considered
too unstable for an otherwise stable release or that the future of the feature
is uncertain (it may be removed any time).

Example:

.. code-block:: nim
  {.experimental.}
  type
    FooId = distinct int
    BarId = distinct int
  using
    foo: FooId
    bar: BarId

  proc useUsing(bar, foo) =
    echo "bar is of type BarId"
    echo "foo is of type FooId"


Implementation Specific Pragmas
===============================

This section describes additional pragmas that the current Nim implementation
supports but which should not be seen as part of the language specification.

Bitsize pragma
--------------

The ``bitsize`` pragma is for object field members. It declares the field as
a bitfield in C/C++.

.. code-block:: Nim
  type
    mybitfield = object
      flag {.bitsize:1.}: cuint

generates:

.. code-block:: C
  struct mybitfield {
    unsigned int flag:1;
  };


Volatile pragma
---------------
The ``volatile`` pragma is for variables only. It declares the variable as
``volatile``, whatever that means in C/C++ (its semantics are not well defined
in C/C++).

**Note**: This pragma will not exist for the LLVM backend.


NoDecl pragma
-------------
The ``noDecl`` pragma can be applied to almost any symbol (variable, proc,
type, etc.) and is sometimes useful for interoperability with C:
It tells Nim that it should not generate a declaration for the symbol in
the C code. For example:

.. code-block:: Nim
  var
    EACCES {.importc, noDecl.}: cint # pretend EACCES was a variable, as
                                     # Nim does not know its value

However, the ``header`` pragma is often the better alternative.

**Note**: This will not work for the LLVM backend.


Header pragma
-------------
The ``header`` pragma is very similar to the ``noDecl`` pragma: It can be
applied to almost any symbol and specifies that it should not be declared
and instead the generated code should contain an ``#include``:

.. code-block:: Nim
  type
    PFile {.importc: "FILE*", header: "<stdio.h>".} = distinct pointer
      # import C's FILE* type; Nim will treat it as a new pointer type

The ``header`` pragma always expects a string constant. The string contant
contains the header file: As usual for C, a system header file is enclosed
in angle brackets: ``<>``. If no angle brackets are given, Nim
encloses the header file in ``""`` in the generated C code.

**Note**: This will not work for the LLVM backend.


IncompleteStruct pragma
-----------------------
The ``incompleteStruct`` pragma tells the compiler to not use the
underlying C ``struct`` in a ``sizeof`` expression:

.. code-block:: Nim
  type
    DIR* {.importc: "DIR", header: "<dirent.h>",
           final, pure, incompleteStruct.} = object


Compile pragma
--------------
The ``compile`` pragma can be used to compile and link a C/C++ source file
with the project:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.compile: "myfile.cpp".}

**Note**: Nim computes a SHA1 checksum and only recompiles the file if it
has changed. You can use the ``-f`` command line option to force recompilation
of the file.


Link pragma
-----------
The ``link`` pragma can be used to link an additional file with the project:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.link: "myfile.o".}


PassC pragma
------------
The ``passC`` pragma can be used to pass additional parameters to the C
compiler like you would using the commandline switch ``--passC``:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.passC: "-Wall -Werror".}

Note that you can use ``gorge`` from the `system module <system.html>`_ to
embed parameters from an external command at compile time:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.passC: gorge("pkg-config --cflags sdl").}

PassL pragma
------------
The ``passL`` pragma can be used to pass additional parameters to the linker
like you would using the commandline switch ``--passL``:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.passL: "-lSDLmain -lSDL".}

Note that you can use ``gorge`` from the `system module <system.html>`_ to
embed parameters from an external command at compile time:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.passL: gorge("pkg-config --libs sdl").}


Emit pragma
-----------
The ``emit`` pragma can be used to directly affect the output of the
compiler's code generator. So it makes your code unportable to other code
generators/backends. Its usage is highly discouraged! However, it can be
extremely useful for interfacing with `C++`:idx: or `Objective C`:idx: code.

Example:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.emit: """
  static int cvariable = 420;
  """.}

  {.push stackTrace:off.}
  proc embedsC() =
    var nimVar = 89
    # use backticks to access Nim symbols within an emit section:
    {.emit: """fprintf(stdout, "%d\n", cvariable + (int)`nimVar`);""".}
  {.pop.}

  embedsC()

As can be seen from the example, to Nim symbols can be referred via backticks.
Use two backticks to produce a single verbatim backtick.

For a toplevel emit statement the section where in the generated C/C++ file
the code should be emitted can be influenced via the
prefixes ``/*TYPESECTION*/`` or ``/*VARSECTION*/`` or ``/*INCLUDESECTION*/``:

.. code-block:: Nim
  {.emit: """/*TYPESECTION*/
  struct Vector3 {
  public:
    Vector3(): x(5) {}
    Vector3(float x_): x(x_) {}
    float x;
  };
  """.}

  type Vector3 {.importcpp: "Vector3", nodecl} = object
    x: cfloat

  proc constructVector3(a: cfloat): Vector3 {.importcpp: "Vector3(@)", nodecl}


ImportCpp pragma
----------------

**Note**: `c2nim <c2nim.html>`_ can parse a large subset of C++ and knows
about the ``importcpp`` pragma pattern language. It is not necessary
to know all the details described here.


Similar to the `importc pragma for C <manual.html#importc-pragma>`_, the
``importcpp`` pragma can be used to import `C++`:idx: methods or C++ symbols
in general. The generated code then uses the C++ method calling
syntax: ``obj->method(arg)``.  In combination with the ``header`` and ``emit``
pragmas this allows *sloppy* interfacing with libraries written in C++:

.. code-block:: Nim
  # Horrible example of how to interface with a C++ engine ... ;-)

  {.link: "/usr/lib/libIrrlicht.so".}

  {.emit: """
  using namespace irr;
  using namespace core;
  using namespace scene;
  using namespace video;
  using namespace io;
  using namespace gui;
  """.}

  const
    irr = "<irrlicht/irrlicht.h>"

  type
    IrrlichtDeviceObj {.final, header: irr,
                        importcpp: "IrrlichtDevice".} = object
    IrrlichtDevice = ptr IrrlichtDeviceObj

  proc createDevice(): IrrlichtDevice {.
    header: irr, importcpp: "createDevice(@)".}
  proc run(device: IrrlichtDevice): bool {.
    header: irr, importcpp: "#.run(@)".}

The compiler needs to be told to generate C++ (command ``cpp``) for
this to work. The conditional symbol ``cpp`` is defined when the compiler
emits C++ code.


Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~

The *sloppy interfacing* example uses ``.emit`` to produce ``using namespace``
declarations. It is usually much better to instead refer to the imported name
via the ``namespace::identifier`` notation:

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    IrrlichtDeviceObj {.final, header: irr,
                        importcpp: "irr::IrrlichtDevice".} = object


Importcpp for enums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``importcpp`` is applied to an enum type the numerical enum values are
annotated with the C++ enum type, like in this example: ``((TheCppEnum)(3))``.
(This turned out to be the simplest way to implement it.)


Importcpp for procs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the ``importcpp`` variant for procs uses a somewhat cryptic pattern
language for maximum flexibility:

- A hash ``#`` symbol is replaced by the first or next argument.
- A dot following the hash ``#.`` indicates that the call should use C++'s dot
  or arrow notation.
- An at symbol ``@`` is replaced by the remaining arguments, separated by
  commas.

For example:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc cppMethod(this: CppObj, a, b, c: cint) {.importcpp: "#.CppMethod(@)".}
  var x: ptr CppObj
  cppMethod(x[], 1, 2, 3)

Produces:

.. code-block:: C
  x->CppMethod(1, 2, 3)

As a special rule to keep backwards compatibility with older versions of the
``importcpp`` pragma, if there is no special pattern
character (any of ``# ' @``) at all, C++'s
dot or arrow notation is assumed, so the above example can also be written as:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc cppMethod(this: CppObj, a, b, c: cint) {.importcpp: "CppMethod".}

Note that the pattern language naturally also covers C++'s operator overloading
capabilities:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc vectorAddition(a, b: Vec3): Vec3 {.importcpp: "# + #".}
  proc dictLookup(a: Dict, k: Key): Value {.importcpp: "#[#]".}


- An apostrophe ``'`` followed by an integer ``i`` in the range 0..9
  is replaced by the i'th parameter *type*. The 0th position is the result
  type. This can be used to pass types to C++ function templates. Between
  the ``'`` and the digit an asterisk can be used to get to the base type
  of the type. (So it "takes away a star" from the type; ``T*`` becomes ``T``.)
  Two stars can be used to get to the element type of the element type etc.

For example:

.. code-block:: nim

  type Input {.importcpp: "System::Input".} = object
  proc getSubsystem*[T](): ptr T {.importcpp: "SystemManager::getSubsystem<'*0>()", nodecl.}

  let x: ptr Input = getSubsystem[Input]()

Produces:

.. code-block:: C
  x = SystemManager::getSubsystem<System::Input>()


- ``#@`` is a special case to support a ``cnew`` operation. It is required so
  that the call expression is inlined directly, without going through a
  temporary location. This is only required to circumvent a limitation of the
  current code generator.

For example C++'s ``new`` operator can be "imported" like this:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc cnew*[T](x: T): ptr T {.importcpp: "(new '*0#@)", nodecl.}

  # constructor of 'Foo':
  proc constructFoo(a, b: cint): Foo {.importcpp: "Foo(@)".}

  let x = cnew constructFoo(3, 4)

Produces:

.. code-block:: C
  x = new Foo(3, 4)

However, depending on the use case ``new Foo`` can also be wrapped like this
instead:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc newFoo(a, b: cint): ptr Foo {.importcpp: "new Foo(@)".}

  let x = newFoo(3, 4)


Wrapping constructors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a C++ class has a private copy constructor and so code like
``Class c = Class(1,2);`` must not be generated but instead ``Class c(1,2);``.
For this purpose the Nim proc that wraps a C++ constructor needs to be
annotated with the `constructor`:idx: pragma. This pragma also helps to generate
faster C++ code since construction then doesn't invoke the copy constructor:

.. code-block:: nim
  # a better constructor of 'Foo':
  proc constructFoo(a, b: cint): Foo {.importcpp: "Foo(@)", constructor.}


Wrapping destructors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Nim generates C++ directly, any destructor is called implicitly by the
C++ compiler at the scope exits. This means that often one can get away with
not wrapping the destructor at all! However when it needs to be invoked
explicitly, it needs to be wrapped. But the pattern language already provides
everything that is required for that:

.. code-block:: nim
  proc destroyFoo(this: var Foo) {.importcpp: "#.~Foo()".}


Importcpp for objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generic ``importcpp``'ed objects are mapped to C++ templates. This means that
you can import C++'s templates rather easily without the need for a pattern
language for object types:

.. code-block:: nim
  type
    StdMap {.importcpp: "std::map", header: "<map>".} [K, V] = object
  proc `[]=`[K, V](this: var StdMap[K, V]; key: K; val: V) {.
    importcpp: "#[#] = #", header: "<map>".}

  var x: StdMap[cint, cdouble]
  x[6] = 91.4


Produces:

.. code-block:: C
  std::map<int, double> x;
  x[6] = 91.4;


- If more precise control is needed, the apostrophe ``'`` can be used in the
  supplied pattern to denote the concrete type parameters of the generic type.
  See the usage of the apostrophe operator in proc patterns for more details.

.. code-block:: nim

  type
    VectorIterator {.importcpp: "std::vector<'0>::iterator".} [T] = object

  var x: VectorIterator[cint]


Produces:

.. code-block:: C

  std::vector<int>::iterator x;


ImportObjC pragma
-----------------
Similar to the `importc pragma for C <manual.html#importc-pragma>`_, the
``importobjc`` pragma can be used to import `Objective C`:idx: methods.  The
generated code then uses the Objective C method calling syntax: ``[obj method
param1: arg]``.  In addition with the ``header`` and ``emit`` pragmas this
allows *sloppy* interfacing with libraries written in Objective C:

.. code-block:: Nim
  # horrible example of how to interface with GNUStep ...

  {.passL: "-lobjc".}
  {.emit: """
  #include <objc/Object.h>
  @interface Greeter:Object
  {
  }

  - (void)greet:(long)x y:(long)dummy;
  @end

  #include <stdio.h>
  @implementation Greeter

  - (void)greet:(long)x y:(long)dummy
  {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
  }
  @end

  #include <stdlib.h>
  """.}

  type
    Id {.importc: "id", header: "<objc/Object.h>", final.} = distinct int

  proc newGreeter: Id {.importobjc: "Greeter new", nodecl.}
  proc greet(self: Id, x, y: int) {.importobjc: "greet", nodecl.}
  proc free(self: Id) {.importobjc: "free", nodecl.}

  var g = newGreeter()
  g.greet(12, 34)
  g.free()

The compiler needs to be told to generate Objective C (command ``objc``) for
this to work. The conditional symbol ``objc`` is defined when the compiler
emits Objective C code.


CodegenDecl pragma
------------------

The ``codegenDecl`` pragma can be used to directly influence Nim's code
generator. It receives a format string that determines how the variable or
proc is declared in the generated code:

.. code-block:: nim
  var
    a {.codegenDecl: "$# progmem $#".}: int

  proc myinterrupt() {.codegenDecl: "__interrupt $# $#$#".} =
    echo "realistic interrupt handler"


InjectStmt pragma
-----------------

The ``injectStmt`` pragma can be used to inject a statement before every
other statement in the current module. It is only supposed to be used for
debugging:

.. code-block:: nim
  {.injectStmt: gcInvariants().}

  # ... complex code here that produces crashes ...
