# v1.8.x - yyyy-mm-dd


## Changes affecting backward compatibility


- Optional parameters in combination with `: body` syntax (RFC #405) are now opt-in via
  `experimental:flexibleOptionalParams`.

## Standard library additions and changes

## Standard library additions and changes

- `macros.parseExpr` and `macros.parseStmt` now accept an optional
  filename argument for more informative errors.
- Module `colors` expanded with missing colors from the CSS color standard.
- Fixed `lists.SinglyLinkedList` being broken after removing the last node ([#19353](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/19353)).


## Language changes


- Pragma macros on type definitions can now return `nnkTypeSection` nodes as well as `nnkTypeDef`,
  allowing multiple type definitions to be injected in place of the original type definition.

  ```nim
  import macros

  macro multiply(amount: static int, s: untyped): untyped =
    let name = $s[0].basename
    result = newNimNode(nnkTypeSection)
    for i in 1 .. amount:
      result.add(newTree(nnkTypeDef, ident(name & $i), s[1], s[2]))

  type
    Foo = object
    Bar {.multiply: 3.} = object
      x, y, z: int
    Baz = object

  # becomes

  type
    Foo = object
    Bar1 = object
      x, y, z: int
    Bar2 = object
      x, y, z: int
    Bar3 = object
      x, y, z: int
    Baz = object
  ```
- [Case statement macros](manual.html#macros-case-statement-macros) are no longer experimental,
  meaning you no longer need to enable the experimental switch `caseStmtMacros` to use them.

## Compiler changes

- `nim` can now compile version 1.4.0 as follows: `nim c --lib:lib --stylecheck:off compiler/nim`,
  without requiring `-d:nimVersion140` which is now a noop.

- `--styleCheck` now only applies to the current package.


## Tool changes

- The `gc` switch has been renamed to `mm` ("memory management") in order to reflect the
  reality better. (Nim moved away from all techniques based on "tracing".)

- Nim now supports Nimble version 0.14 which added support for lock-files. This is done by
  a simple configuration change setting that you can do yourself too. In `$nim/config/nim.cfg`
  replace `pkgs` by `pkgs2`.

- There is a new switch `--nimMainPrefix:prefix` to influence the `NimMain` that the
  compiler produces. This is particularly useful for generating static libraries.
