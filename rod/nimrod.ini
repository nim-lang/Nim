Authors: "Andreas Rumpf"
Description: """This is the Nimrod Compiler. Nimrod is a new statically typed,
imperative programming language, that supports procedural, functional, object
oriented and generic programming styles while remaining simple and efficient.
A special feature that Nimrod inherited from Lisp is that Nimrod's abstract
syntax tree (AST) is part of the specification - this allows a powerful macro
system which can be used to create domain specific languages.

Nimrod is a compiled, garbage-collected systems programming language
which has an excellent productivity/performance ratio. Nimrod's design
focuses on the 3E: efficiency, expressiveness, elegance (in the order of
priority)."""
