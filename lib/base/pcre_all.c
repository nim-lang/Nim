/* Table to identify digits and hex digits. This is used when compiling
patterns. Note that the tables in chartables are dependent on the locale, and
may mark arbitrary characters as digits - but the PCRE compiling code expects
to handle only 0-9, a-z, and A-Z as digits when compiling. That is why we have
a private table here. It costs 256 bytes, but it is a lot faster than doing
character value tests (at least in some simple cases I timed), and in some
applications one wants PCRE to compile efficiently as well as match
efficiently.

For convenience, we use the same bit definitions as in chartables:

  0x04   decimal digit
  0x08   hexadecimal digit

Then we can use ctype_digit and ctype_xdigit in the code. */

/* Try to find out if this is an anchored regular expression. Consider each
alternative branch. If they all start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC, or with a bracket
all of whose alternatives start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC (recurse ad lib), then
it's anchored. However, if this is a multiline pattern, then only OP_SOD
counts, since OP_CIRC can match in the middle.

We can also consider a regex to be anchored if OP_SOM starts all its branches.
This is the code for \G, which means "match at start of match position, taking
into account the match offset".

A branch is also implicitly anchored if it starts with .* and DOTALL is set,
because that will try the rest of the pattern at all possible matching points,
so there is no point trying again.... er ....

.... except when the .* appears inside capturing parentheses, and there is a
subsequent back reference to those parentheses. We haven't enough information
to catch that case precisely.

At first, the best we could do was to detect when .* was in capturing brackets
and the highest back reference was greater than or equal to that level.
However, by keeping a bitmap of the first 31 back references, we can catch some
of the more common cases more precisely.

            this is at the very start of the pattern (indicated by item_count
            being zero), we use it to set the global options. This is helpful
            when analyzing the pattern for first characters, etc. Otherwise
            nothing is done here and it is handled during the compiling
            process.

            We allow for more than one options setting at the start. If such
            settings do not change the existing options, nothing is compiled.
            However, we must leave space just in case something is compiled.
            This can happen for pathological sequences such as (?i)(?-i)
            because the global options will end up with -i set. The space is
            small and not significant. (Before I did this there was a reported
            bug with (?i)(?-i) in a machine-generated pattern.)

            [Historical note: Up to Perl 5.8, options settings at top level
            were always global settings, wherever they appeared in the pattern.
            That is, they were equivalent to an external setting. From 5.8
            onwards, they apply only to what follows (which is what you might
            expect).] */

****************************************************************************
                   RECURSION IN THE match() FUNCTION

The match() function is highly recursive. Some regular expressions can cause
it to recurse thousands of times. I was writing for Unix, so I just let it
call itself recursively. This uses the stack for saving everything that has
to be saved for a recursive call. On Unix, the stack can be large, and this
works fine.

It turns out that on non-Unix systems there are problems with programs that
use a lot of stack. (This despite the fact that every last chip has oodles
of memory these days, and techniques for extending the stack have been known
for decades.) So....

There is a fudge, triggered by defining NO_RECURSE, which avoids recursive
calls by keeping local variables that need to be preserved in blocks of memory
obtained from malloc instead instead of on the stack. Macros are used to
achieve this so that the actual code doesn't look very different to what it
always used to.

/* On entry ecode points to the first opcode, and eptr to the first character
in the subject string, while eptrb holds the value of eptr at the start of the
last bracketed group - used for breaking infinite loops matching zero-length
strings. This function is called recursively in many circumstances. Whenever it
returns a negative (error) response, the outer incarnation must also return the
same response.

Performance note: It might be tempting to extract commonly used fields from the
md structure (e.g. utf8, end_subject) into individual variables to improve
performance. Tests using gcc on a SPARC disproved this; in the first case, it
made performance worse.

Arguments:
   eptr        pointer in subject
   ecode       position in code
   offset_top  current top pointer
   md          pointer to "static" info for the match
   ims         current /i, /m, and /s options
   eptrb       pointer to chain of blocks containing eptr at start of
                 brackets - for testing for empty matches
   flags       can contain
                 match_condassert - this is an assertion condition
                 match_isgroup - this is the start of a bracketed group

Returns:       MATCH_MATCH if matched            )  these values are >= 0
               MATCH_NOMATCH if failed to match  )
               a negative PCRE_ERROR_xxx value if aborted by an error condition

    returning to the top level with an error. Save the top REC_STACK_SAVE_MAX

/* This function applies a compiled re to a subject string and picks out

Arguments:
  argument_re     points to the compiled expression
  extra_data      points to extra data or is NULL
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  offsets         points to a vector of ints to be filled in with offsets
  offsetcount     the number of elements in the vector

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of elements filled in

         units of the offset are node items.

     (2) The 0x0fff bits of f2 contain the signed offset from this character to
         its alternate cased value. They are zero if there is no such
         character.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
||.|.| type (6) | ms char (8) ||  ls char (16)  ||....|  case offset (12)  ||
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | |                                              |
  | |-> spare                                      |
  |                                        exponent of right
  |-> left child exists                       child offset


The upper/lower casing information is set only for characters that come in
pairs. There are (at present) four non-one-to-one mappings in the Unicode data.
These are ignored. They are:

  1FBE Greek Prosgegrammeni (lower, with upper -> capital iota)
  2126 Ohm
  212A Kelvin
  212B Angstrom

Certainly for the last three, having an alternate case would seem to be a
mistake. I don't know any Greek, so cannot comment on the first one.


When searching the tree, proceed as follows:

(1) Start at the first node.

(2) Extract the character value from f1 and the bottom 8 bits of f0;

(3) Compare with the character being sought. If equal, we are done.

(4) If the test character is smaller, inspect the f0_leftexists flag. If it is
    not set, the character is not in the tree. If it is set, move to the next
    node, and go to (2).

(5) If the test character is bigger, extract the f2_rightmask bits from f2, and
    shift them right by f2_rightshift. If the result is zero, the character is
    not in the tree. Otherwise, calculate the number of nodes to skip by
    shifting the value 1 left by this number minus one. Go to (2).

that subsequent code can assume it is dealing with a valid string. The check

Returns:       < 0    if the string is a valid UTF-8 string
