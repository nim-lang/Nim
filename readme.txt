          Nimrod Compiler
===========================================================

This is the **Nimrod Compiler**. Nimrod is a new statically typed, imperative 
programming language, that supports procedural, functional, object oriented and 
generic programming styles while remaining simple and efficient. A special 
feature that Nimrod inherited from Lisp is that Nimrod's abstract syntax tree
(AST) is part of the specification - this allows a powerful macro system which 
can be used to create domain specific languages.

*Nimrod* is a compiled, garbage-collected systems programming language 
which has an excellent productivity/performance ratio. Nimrod's design 
focuses on efficiency, expressiveness, elegance (in the order of 
priority). 

See the file ``install.txt`` for installation instructions. See the file
``doc/intern.txt`` for the internal documentation for developers.
