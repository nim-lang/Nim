  2015-03-01 Version 0.10.4 released
  ==================================


  Changes affecting backwards compatibility
  -----------------------------------------

  - Parameter names are finally properly ``gensym``'ed. This can break
    templates though that used to rely on the fact that they are not.
    (Bug #1915.) This means this doesn't compile anymore:

  .. code-block:: nim

    template doIt(body: stmt) {.immediate.} =
      # this used to inject the 'str' parameter:
      proc res(str: string) =
        body

    doIt:
      echo str # Error: undeclared identifier: 'str'

    Declare the ``doIt`` template as ``immediate, dirty`` to get the old
    behaviour.
  - Tuple field names are not ignored anymore, this caused too many problems
    in practice so now the behaviour as it was for version 0.9.6: If field
    names exist for the tuple type, they are checked.
  - ``logging.level`` and ``logging.handlers`` are no longer exported.
    ``addHandler``, ``getHandlers``, ``setLogFilter`` and ``getLogFilter``
    should be used instead.
  - ``nim idetools`` has been replaced by a separate tool `nimsuggest`_.
  - *arrow like* operators are not right associative anymore.
  - Typeless parameters are now only allowed in templates and macros. The old
    way turned out to be too error-prone.
  - The 'addr' and 'type' operators are now parsed as unary function
    application. This means ``type(x).name`` is now parsed as ``(type(x)).name``
    and not as ``type((x).name)``. Note that this also affects the AST
    structure; for immediate macro parameters ``nkCall('addr', 'x')`` is
    produced instead of ``nkAddr('x')``.
  - ``concept`` is now a keyword and is used instead of ``generic``.


  Language Additions
  ------------------

  - For empty ``case object`` branches ``discard`` can finally be used instead
    of ``nil``.
  - Automatic dereferencing is now done for the first argument of a routine
    call if overloading resolution produces no match otherwise. This feature
    has to be enabled with the `experimental`_ pragma.
  - Objects that do not use inheritance nor ``case`` can be put into ``const``
    sections. This means that finally this is possible and produces rather
    nice code:

  .. code-block:: nim
    import tables

    const
      foo = {"ah": "finally", "this": "is", "possible.": "nice!"}.toTable()


  - Ordinary parameters can follow after a varargs parameter. This means the
    following is finally accepted by the compiler:

  .. code-block:: nim
    template takesBlock(a, b: int, x: varargs[expr]; blck: stmt) =
      blck
      echo a, b

    takesBlock 1, 2, "some", 0.90, "random stuff":
      echo "yay"

  - Overloading by 'var T' is now finally possible:

  .. code-block:: nim
    proc varOrConst(x: var int) = echo "var"
    proc varOrConst(x: int) = echo "const"

    var x: int
    varOrConst(x) # "var"
    varOrConst(45) # "const"


  Library additions
  -----------------

  - ``reversed`` proc added to the ``unicode`` module.
  - Added multipart param to httpclient's ``post`` and ``postContent`` together
    with a ``newMultipartData`` proc.
  - Added `%*` operator for JSON.
  - The compiler is now available as Nimble package for c2nim.

2014-12-29 Version 0.10.2 released
==================================

This release marks the completion of a very important change to the project:
the official renaming from Nimrod to Nim. Version 0.10.2 contains many language
changes, some of which may break your existing code. For your convenience, we
added a new tool called `nimfix <nimfix.html>`_ that will help you convert your
existing projects so that it works with the latest version of the compiler.

Progress towards version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although Nim is still pre-1.0, we were able to keep the number of breaking
changes to a minimum so far. Starting with version 1.0, we will not introduce
any breaking changes between major release versions.
One of Nim's goals is to ensure that the compiler is as efficient as possible.
Take a look at the
`latest benchmarks <https://github.com/logicchains/LPATHBench/blob/master/writeup.md>`_,
which show that Nim is consistently near
the top and already nearly as fast as C and C++. Recent developments, such as
the new ``asyncdispatch`` module will allow you to write efficient web server
applications using non-blocking code. Nim now also has a built-in thread pool
for lightweight threading through the use of ``spawn``.

The unpopular "T" and "P" prefixes on types have been deprecated. Nim also
became more expressive by weakening the distinction between statements and
expressions. We also added a new and searchable forum, a new website, and our
documentation generator ``docgen`` has seen major improvements. Many thanks to
Nick Greenfield for the much more beautiful documentation!



What's left to be done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 1.0 release is actually very close. Apart from bug fixes, there are
two major features missing or incomplete:

* ``static[T]`` needs to be defined precisely and the bugs in the
  implementation need to be fixed.
* Overloading of the assignment operator is required for some generic
  containers and needs to be implemented.

This means that fancy matrix libraries will finally start to work, which used
to be a major point of pain in the language.


Nimble and other Nim tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outside of the language and the compiler itself many Nim tools have seen
considerable improvements.

Babel the Nim package manager has been renamed to Nimble. Nimble's purpose
is the installation of packages containing libraries and/or applications
written in Nim.
Even though Nimble is still very young it already is very
functional. It can install packages by name, it does so by accessing a
packages repository which is hosted on a Github repo. Packages can also be
installed via a Git repo URL or Mercurial repo URL. The package repository
is searchable through Nimble. Anyone is free to add their own packages to
the package repository by forking the
`nim-lang/packages <https://github.com/nim-lang/packages>`_ repo and creating
a pull request. Nimble is fully cross-platform and should be fully functional
on all major operating systems.
It is of course completely written in Nim.

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- **The language has been renamed from Nimrod to Nim.** The name of the
  compiler changed from ``nimrod`` to ``nim`` too.
- ``system.fileHandle`` has been renamed to ``system.getFileHandle`` to
  prevent name conflicts with the new type ``FileHandle``.
- Comments are now not part of the AST anymore, as such you cannot use them
  in place of ``discard``.
- Large parts of the stdlib got rid of the T/P type prefixes. Instead most
  types now simply start with an uppercased letter. The
  so called "partial case sensitivity" rule is now active allowing for code
  like ``var foo: Foo`` in more contexts.
- String case (or any non-ordinal case) statements
  without 'else' are deprecated.
- Recursive tuple types are not allowed anymore. Use ``object`` instead.
- The PEGS module returns ``nil`` instead of ``""`` when an optional capture
  fails to match.
- The re module returns ``nil`` instead of ``""`` when an optional capture
  fails to match.
- The "symmetric set difference" operator (``-+-``) never worked and has been
  removed.
- ``defer`` is a keyword now.
- ``func`` is a keyword now.
- The ``using`` language feature now needs to be activated via the new
  ``{.experimental.}`` pragma that enables experimental language features.
- Destructors are now officially *experimental*.
- Standalone ``except`` and ``finally`` statements are deprecated now.
  The standalone ``finally`` can be replaced with ``defer``,
  standalone ``except`` requires an explicit ``try``.
- Operators ending in ``>`` are considered as "arrow like" and have their
  own priority level and are right associative. This means that
  the ``=>`` and ``->`` operators from the `future <future.html>`_ module
  work better.
- Field names in tuples are now ignored for type comparisons. This allows
  for greater interoperability between different modules.
- Statement lists are not converted to an implicit ``do`` block anymore. This
  means the confusing ``nnkDo`` nodes when working with macros are gone for
  good.


Language Additions
------------------

- The new concurrency model has been implemented including ``locks`` sections,
  lock levels and object field ``guards``.
- The ``parallel`` statement has been implemented.
- ``deepCopy`` has been added to the language.
- The builtin ``procCall`` can be used to get ``super``-like functionality
  for multi methods.
- There is a new pragma ``{.experimental.}`` that enables experimental
  language features per module, or you can enable these features on a global
  level with the ``--experimental`` command line option.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The compiler now supports *mixed* Objective C / C++ / C code generation:
  The modules that use ``importCpp`` or ``importObjc`` are compiled to C++
  or Objective C code, any other module is compiled to C code. This
  improves interoperability.
- There is a new ``parallel`` statement for safe fork&join parallel computing.
- ``guard`` and ``lock`` pragmas have been implemented to support safer
  concurrent programming.
- The following procs are now available at compile-time::

    math.sqrt, math.ln, math.log10, math.log2, math.exp, math.round,
    math.arccos, math.arcsin, math.arctan, math.arctan2, math.cos,
    math.cosh, math.hypot, math.sinh, math.sin, math.tan, math.tanh,
    math.pow, math.trunc, math.floor, math.ceil, math.fmod,
    os.getEnv, os.existsEnv, os.dirExists, os.fileExists,
    system.writeFile

- Two backticks now produce a single backtick within an ``emit`` or ``asm``
  statement.
- There is a new tool, `nimfix <nimfix.html>`_ to help you in updating your
  code from Nimrod to Nim.
- The compiler's output has been prettified.

Library Additions
-----------------

- Added module ``fenv`` to control the handling of floating-point rounding and
  exceptions (overflow, division by zero, etc.).
- ``system.setupForeignThreadGc`` can be used for better interaction with
  foreign libraries that create threads and run a Nim callback from these
  foreign threads.
- List comprehensions have been implemented as a macro in the ``future``
  module.
- The new Async module (``asyncnet``) now supports SSL.
- The ``smtp`` module now has an async implementation.
- Added module ``asyncfile`` which implements asynchronous file reading
  and writing.
- ``osproc.kill`` has been added.
- ``asyncnet`` and ``asynchttpserver`` now support ``SO_REUSEADDR``.

Bugfixes
--------

- ``nil`` and ``NULL`` are now preserved between Nim and databases in the
  ``db_*`` modules.
- Fixed issue with OS module in non-unicode mode on Windows.
- Fixed issue with ``x.low``
  (`#1366 <https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/1366>`_).
- Fixed tuple unpacking issue inside closure iterators
  (`#1067 <https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/1067>`_).
- Fixed ENDB compilation issues.
- Many ``asynchttpserver`` fixes.
- Macros can now keep global state across macro calls
  (`#903 <https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/903>`_).
- ``osproc`` fixes on Windows.
- ``osproc.terminate`` fixed.
- Improvements to exception handling in async procedures.
  (`#1487 <https://github.com/Araq/Nim/issues/1487>`_).
- ``try`` now works at compile-time.
- Fixes ``T = ref T`` to be an illegal recursive type.
- Self imports are now disallowed.
- Improved effect inference.
- Fixes for the ``math`` module on Windows.
- User defined pragmas will now work for generics that have
  been instantiated in different modules.
- Fixed queue exhaustion bug.
- Many, many more.

2014-12-09 New website design!
==============================

A brand new website including an improved forum is now live.
All thanks go to Philip Witte and
Dominik Picheta, Philip Witte for the design of the website (together with
the logo) as well as the HTML and CSS code for his template, and Dominik Picheta
for integrating Philip's design with Nim's forum. We're sure you will
agree that Philip's design is beautiful.



2014-10-19 Version 0.9.6 released
=================================

**Note: 0.9.6 is the last release of Nimrod. The language is being renamed to
Nim. Nim slightly breaks compatibility.**

This is a maintenance release. The upcoming 0.10.0 release has
the new features and exciting developments.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- ``spawn`` now uses an elaborate self-adapting thread pool and as such
  has been moved into its own module. So to use it, you now have to import
  ``threadpool``.
- The symbol binding rules in generics changed: ``bar`` in ``foo.bar`` is
  now considered for implicit early binding.
- ``c2nim`` moved into its own repository and is now a Babel package.
- ``pas2nim`` moved into its own repository and is now a Babel package.
- ``system.$`` for floating point types now produces a human friendly string
  representation.
- ``uri.TUrl`` as well as the ``parseurl`` module are now deprecated in favour
  of the new ``TUri`` type in the ``uri`` module.
- The ``destructor`` pragma has been deprecated. Use the ``override`` pragma
  instead. The destructor's name has to be ``destroy`` now.
- ``lambda`` is not a keyword anymore.
- **system.defined has been split into system.defined and system.declared**.
  You have to use ``--symbol`` to declare new conditional symbols that can be
  set via ``--define``.
- ``--threadanalysis:on`` is now the default. To make your program compile
  you can disable it but this is only a temporary solution as this option
  will disappear soon!


Compiler improvements
---------------------

- Multi method dispatching performance has been improved by a factor of 10x for
  pathological cases.


Language Additions
------------------

- This version introduces the ``deprecated`` pragma statement that is used
  to handle the upcoming massive amount of symbol renames.
- ``spawn`` can now wrap proc that has a return value. It then returns a data
  flow variable of the wrapped return type.


Library Additions
-----------------

- Added module ``cpuinfo``.
- Added module ``threadpool``.
- ``sequtils.distnct`` has been renamed to ``sequtils.deduplicate``.
- Added ``algorithm.reversed``
- Added ``uri.combine`` and ``uri.parseUri``.
- Some sockets procedures now support a ``SafeDisconn`` flag which causes
  them to handle disconnection errors and not raise them.


2014-04-21 Version 0.9.4 released
=================================

The Nimrod development community is proud to announce the release of version
0.9.4 of the Nimrod compiler and tools. **Note: This release has to be
considered beta quality! Lots of new features have been implemented but
unfortunately some do not fulfill our quality standards yet.**

Prebuilt binaries and instructions for building from source are available
on the `download page <download.html>`_.

This release includes about
`1400 changes <https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.4>`_
in total including various bug
fixes, new languages features and standard library additions and improvements.
This release brings with it support for user-defined type classes, a brand
new VM for executing Nimrod code at compile-time and new symbol binding
rules for clean templates.

It also introduces support for the brand new
`Babel package manager <https://github.com/nimrod-code/babel>`_ which
has itself seen its first release recently. Many of the wrappers that were
present in the standard library have been moved to separate repositories
and should now be installed using Babel.

Apart from that a new **experimental** Asynchronous IO API has been added via
the ``asyncdispatch`` and ``asyncnet`` modules. The ``net`` and ``rawsockets``
modules have also been added and they will likely replace the sockets
module in the next release. The Asynchronous IO API has been designed to
take advantage of Linux's epoll and Windows' IOCP APIs, support for BSD's
kqueue has not been implemented yet but will be in the future.
The Asynchronous IO API provides both
a callback interface and an interface which allows you to write code as you
would if you were writing synchronous code. The latter is done through
the use of an ``await`` macro which behaves similar to C#'s await. The
following is a very simple chat server demonstrating Nimrod's new async
capabilities.

.. code-block::nim
  import asyncnet, asyncdispatch

  var clients: seq[PAsyncSocket] = @[]

  proc processClient(client: PAsyncSocket) {.async.} =
    while true:
      let line = await client.recvLine()
      for c in clients:
        await c.send(line & "\c\L")

  proc serve() {.async.} =
    var server = newAsyncSocket()
    server.bindAddr(TPort(12345))
    server.listen()

    while true:
      let client = await server.accept()
      clients.add client

      processClient(client)

  serve()
  runForever()


Note that this feature has been implemented with Nimrod's macro system and so
``await`` and ``async`` are no keywords.

Syntactic sugar for anonymous procedures has also been introduced. It too has
been implemented as a macro. The following shows some simple usage of the new
syntax:

.. code-block::nim
  import future

  var s = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  echo(s.map((x: int) => x * 5))

A list of changes follows, for a comprehensive list of changes take a look
`here <https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.4>`_.

Library Additions
-----------------

- Added ``macros.genSym`` builtin for AST generation.
- Added ``macros.newLit`` procs for easier AST generation.
- Added module ``logging``.
- Added module ``asyncdispatch``.
- Added module ``asyncnet``.
- Added module ``net``.
- Added module ``rawsockets``.
- Added module ``selectors``.
- Added module ``asynchttpserver``.
- Added support for the new asynchronous IO in the ``httpclient`` module.
- Added a Python-inspired ``future`` module that features upcoming additions
  to the ``system`` module.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- The scoping rules for the ``if`` statement changed for better interaction
  with the new syntactic construct ``(;)``.
- ``OSError`` family of procedures has been deprecated. Procedures with the same
  name but which take different parameters have been introduced. These procs now
  require an error code to be passed to them. This error code can be retrieved
  using the new ``OSLastError`` proc.
- ``os.parentDir`` now returns "" if there is no parent dir.
- In CGI scripts stacktraces are shown to the user only
  if ``cgi.setStackTraceStdout`` is used.
- The symbol binding rules for clean templates changed: ``bind`` for any
  symbol that's not a parameter is now the default. ``mixin`` can be used
  to require instantiation scope for a symbol.
- ``quoteIfContainsWhite`` now escapes argument in such way that it can be safely
  passed to shell, instead of just adding double quotes.
- ``macros.dumpTree`` and ``macros.dumpLisp`` have been made ``immediate``,
  ``dumpTreeImm`` and ``dumpLispImm`` are now deprecated.
- The ``nil`` statement has been deprecated, use an empty ``discard`` instead.
- ``sockets.select`` now prunes sockets that are **not** ready from the list
  of sockets given to it.
- The ``noStackFrame`` pragma has been renamed to ``asmNoStackFrame`` to
  ensure you only use it when you know what you're doing.
- Many of the wrappers that were present in the standard library have been
  moved to separate repositories and should now be installed using Babel.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The compiler can now warn about "uninitialized" variables. (There are no
  real uninitialized variables in Nimrod as they are initialized to binary
  zero). Activate via ``{.warning[Uninit]:on.}``.
- The compiler now enforces the ``not nil`` constraint.
- The compiler now supports a ``codegenDecl`` pragma for even more control
  over the generated code.
- The compiler now supports a ``computedGoto`` pragma to support very fast
  dispatching for interpreters and the like.
- The old evaluation engine has been replaced by a proper register based
  virtual machine. This fixes numerous bugs for ``nimrod i`` and for macro
  evaluation.
- ``--gc:none`` produces warnings when code uses the GC.
- A ``union`` pragma for better C interoperability is now supported.
- A ``packed`` pragma to control the memory packing/alignment of fields in
  an object.
- Arrays can be annotated to be ``unchecked`` for easier low level
  manipulations of memory.
- Support for the new Babel package manager.


Language Additions
------------------

- Arrays can now be declared with a single integer literal ``N`` instead of a
  range; the range is then ``0..N-1``.
- Added ``requiresInit`` pragma to enforce explicit initialization.
- Exported templates are allowed to access hidden fields.
- The ``using statement`` enables you to more easily author domain-specific
  languages and libraries providing OOP-like syntactic sugar.
- Added the possibility to override various dot operators in order to handle
  calls to missing procs and reads from undeclared fields at compile-time.
- The overload resolution now supports ``static[T]`` params that must be
  evaluable at compile-time.
- Support for user-defined type classes has been added.
- The *command syntax* is supported in a lot more contexts.
- Anonymous iterators are now supported and iterators can capture variables
  of an outer proc.
- The experimental ``strongSpaces`` parsing mode has been implemented.
- You can annotate pointer types with regions for increased type safety.
- Added support for the builtin ``spawn`` for easy thread pool usage.


Tools improvements
------------------

- c2nim can deal with a subset of C++. Use the ``--cpp`` command line option
  to activate.

for integrating Philip's design with the ``nimweb`` utility. We're sure you will
agree that Philip's design is beautiful.


2013-05-20 Version 0.9.2 released
=================================

We are pleased to announce that version 0.9.2 of the Nimrod compiler has been
released. This release has attracted by far the most contributions in comparison
to any other release.

This release brings with it many new features and bug fixes, a list of which
can be seen later. One of the major new features is the effect system together
with exception tracking which allows for checked exceptions and more,
for further details check out the `manual <manual.html#effect-system>`_.
Another major new feature is the introduction of statement list expressions,
more details on these can be found `here <manual.html#statement-list-expression>`_.
The ability to exclude symbols from modules has also been
implemented, this feature can be used like so: ``import module except symbol``.

Thanks to all `contributors <https://github.com/Araq/Nimrod/contributors>`_!

Bugfixes
--------

- The old GC never collected cycles correctly. Fixed but it can cause
  performance regressions. However you can deactivate the cycle collector
  with ``GC_disableMarkAndSweep`` and run it explicitly at an appropriate time
  or not at all. There is also a new GC you can activate
  with ``--gc:markAndSweep`` which does not have this problem but is slower in
  general and has no realtime guarantees.
- ``cast`` for floating point types now does the bitcast as specified in the
  manual. This breaks code that erroneously uses ``cast`` to convert different
  floating point values.
- SCGI module's performance has been improved greatly, it will no longer block
  on many concurrent requests.
- In total fixed over 70 github issues and merged over 60 pull requests.


Library Additions
-----------------

- There is a new experimental mark&sweep GC which can be faster (or much
  slower) than the default GC. Enable with ``--gc:markAndSweep``.
- Added ``system.onRaise`` to support a condition system.
- Added ``system.locals`` that provides access to a proc's locals.
- Added ``macros.quote`` for AST quasi-quoting.
- Added ``system.unsafeNew`` to support hacky variable length objects.
- ``system.fields`` and ``system.fieldPairs`` support ``object`` too; they
  used to only support tuples.
- Added ``system.CurrentSourcePath`` returning the full file-system path of
  the current source file.
- The ``macros`` module now contains lots of useful helpers for building up
  abstract syntax trees.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- ``shared`` is a keyword now.
- Deprecated ``sockets.recvLine`` and ``asyncio.recvLine``, added
  ``readLine`` instead.
- The way indentation is handled in the parser changed significantly. However,
  this affects very little (if any) real world code.
- The expression/statement unification has been implemented. Again this
  only affects edge cases and no known real world code.
- Changed the async interface of the ``scgi`` module.
- WideStrings are now garbage collected like other string types.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The ``doc2`` command does not generate output for the whole project anymore.
  Use the new ``--project`` switch to enable this behaviour.
- The compiler can now warn about shadowed local variables. However, this needs
  to be turned on explicitly via ``--warning[ShadowIdent]:on``.
- The compiler now supports almost every pragma in a ``push`` pragma.
- Generic converters have been implemented.
- Added a **highly experimental** ``noforward`` pragma enabling a special
  compilation mode that largely eliminates the need for forward declarations.

Language Additions
------------------

- ``case expressions`` are now supported.
- Table constructors now mimic more closely the syntax of the ``case``
  statement.
- Nimrod can now infer the return type of a proc from its body.
- Added a ``mixin`` declaration to affect symbol binding rules in generics.
- Exception tracking has been added and the ``doc2`` command annotates possible
  exceptions for you.
- User defined effects ("tags") tracking has been added and the ``doc2``
  command annotates possible tags for you.
- Types can be annotated with the new syntax ``not nil`` to explicitly state
  that ``nil`` is not allowed. However currently the compiler performs no
  advanced static checking for this; for now it's merely for documentation
  purposes.
- An ``export`` statement has been added to the language: It can be used for
  symbol forwarding so client modules don't have to import a module's
  dependencies explicitly.
- Overloading based on ASTs has been implemented.
- Generics are now supported for multi methods.
- Objects can be initialized via an *object constructor expression*.
- There is a new syntactic construct ``(;)`` unifying expressions and
  statements.
- You can now use ``from module import nil`` if you want to import the module
  but want to enforce fully qualified access to every symbol in ``module``.


Notes for the future
--------------------

- The scope rules of ``if`` statements will change in 0.9.4. This affects the
  ``=~`` pegs/re templates.
- The ``sockets`` module will become a low-level wrapper of OS-specific socket
  functions. All the high-level features of the current ``sockets`` module
  will be moved to a ``network`` module.


2012-09-23 Version 0.9.0 released
=================================

Summary
-------

* Unsigned integers have been added.
* The integer type promotion rules changed.
* The template and macro system evolved.
* Closures have been implemented.
* Term rewriting macros have been implemented.
* First steps to unify expressions and statements have been taken.
* Symbol lookup rules in generics have become stricter to catch more errors.


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed a bug where the compiler would "optimize away" valid constant parts of
  a string concatenation.
- Fixed a bug concerning implicit type conversions in ``case`` statements.
- Fixed a serious code generation bug that caused ``algorithm.sort`` to
  produce segmentation faults.
- Fixed ambiguity in recvLine which meant that receiving ``\r\L`` was
  indistinguishable from disconnections.
- Many more bugfixes, too many to list them all.


Library Additions
-----------------

- Added the (already existing) module ``htmlgen`` to the documentation.
- Added the (already existing) module ``cookies`` to the documentation.
- Added ``system.shallow`` that can be used to speed up string and sequence
  assignments.
- Added ``system.eval`` that can execute an anonymous block of code at
  compile time as if was a macro.
- Added ``system.staticExec`` and ``system.gorge`` for compile-time execution
  of external programs.
- Added ``system.staticRead`` as a synonym for ``system.slurp``.
- Added ``macros.emit`` that can emit an arbitrary computed string as nimrod
  code during compilation.
- Added ``strutils.parseEnum``.
- Added ``json.%`` constructor operator.
- The stdlib can now be avoided to a point where C code generation for 16bit
  micro controllers is feasible.
- Added module ``oids``.
- Added module ``endians``.
- Added a new OpenGL wrapper that supports OpenGL up to version 4.2.
- Added a wrapper for ``libsvm``.
- Added a wrapper for ``mongodb``.
- Added ``terminal.isatty``.
- Added an overload for ``system.items`` that can be used to iterate over the
  values of an enum.
- Added ``system.TInteger`` and ``system.TNumber`` type classes matching
  any of the corresponding types available in Nimrod.
- Added ``system.clamp`` to limit a value within an interval ``[a, b]``.
- Added ``strutils.continuesWith``.
- Added ``system.getStackTrace``.
- Added ``system.||`` for parallel ``for`` loop support.
- The GC supports (soft) realtime systems via ``GC_setMaxPause``
  and ``GC_step`` procs.
- The sockets module now supports ssl through the OpenSSL library, ``recvLine``
  is now much more efficient thanks to the newly implemented sockets buffering.
- The httpclient module now supports ssl/tls.
- Added ``times.format`` as well as many other utility functions
  for managing time.
- Added ``system.@`` for converting an ``openarray`` to a ``seq`` (it used to
  only support fixed length arrays).
- Added ``system.compiles`` which can be used to check whether a type supports
  some operation.
- Added ``strutils.format``, ``subexes.format`` which use the
  new ``varargs`` type.
- Added module ``fsmonitor``.

Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- On Windows filenames and paths are supposed to be in UTF-8.
  The ``system``, ``os``, ``osproc`` and ``memfiles`` modules use the wide
  string versions of the WinAPI. Use the ``-d:useWinAnsi`` switch to revert
  back to the old behaviour which uses the Ansi string versions.
- ``static``, ``do``, ``interface`` and ``mixin`` are now keywords.
- Templates now participate in overloading resolution which can break code that
  uses templates in subtle ways. Use the new ``immediate`` pragma for templates
  to get a template of old behaviour.
- There is now a proper distinction in the type system between ``expr`` and
  ``PNimrodNode`` which unfortunately breaks the old macro system.
- ``pegs.@`` has been renamed to ``pegs.!*`` and ``pegs.@@`` has been renamed
  to ``pegs.!*\`` as ``@`` operators now have different precedence.
- The type ``proc`` (without any params or return type) is now considered a
  type class matching all proc types. Use ``proc ()`` to get the old meaning
  denoting a proc expecing no arguments and returing no value.
- Deprecated ``system.GC_setStrategy``.
- ``re.findAll`` and ``pegs.findAll`` don't return *captures* anymore but
  matching *substrings*.
- RTTI and thus the ``marshall`` module don't contain the proper field names
  of tuples anymore. This had to be changed as the old behaviour never
  produced consistent results.
- Deprecated the ``ssl`` module.
- Deprecated ``nimrod pretty`` as it never worked good enough and has some
  inherent problems.
- The integer promotion rules changed; the compiler is now less picky in some
  situations and more picky in other situations: In particular implicit
  conversions from ``int`` to ``int32`` are now forbidden.
- ``system.byte`` is now an alias for ``uint8``; it used to be an alias
  to ``int8``.
- ``bind`` expressions in templates are not properly supported anymore. Use
  the declarative ``bind`` statement instead.
- The default calling convention for a procedural **type** is now ``closure``,
  for procs it remains ``nimcall`` (which is compatible to ``closure``).
  Activate the warning ``ImplicitClosure`` to make the compiler list the
  occurrences of proc types which are affected.
- The Nimrod type system now distinguishes ``openarray`` from ``varargs``.
- Templates are now ``hygienic``. Use the ``dirty`` pragma to get the old
  behaviour.
- Objects that have no ancestor are now implicitly ``final``. Use
  the ``inheritable`` pragma to introduce new object roots apart
  from ``TObject``.
- Macros now receive parameters like templates do; use the ``callsite`` builtin
  to gain access to the invocation AST.
- Symbol lookup rules in generics have become stricter to catch more errors.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- Win64 is now an officially supported target.
- The Nimrod compiler works on BSD again, but has some issues
  as ``os.getAppFilename`` and ``os.getAppDir`` cannot work reliably on BSD.
- The compiler can detect and evaluate calls that can be evaluated at compile
  time for optimization purposes with the ``--implicitStatic`` command line
  option or pragma.
- The compiler now generates marker procs that the GC can use instead of RTTI.
  This speeds up the GC quite a bit.
- The compiler now includes a new advanced documentation generator
  via the ``doc2`` command. This new generator uses all of the semantic passes
  of the compiler and can thus generate documentation for symbols hiding in
  macros.
- The compiler now supports the ``dynlib`` pragma for variables.
- The compiler now supports ``bycopy`` and ``byref`` pragmas that affect how
  objects/tuples are passed.
- The embedded profiler became a stack trace profiler and has been documented.


Language Additions
------------------

- Added explicit ``static`` sections for enforced compile time evaluation.
- Added an alternative notation for lambdas with ``do``.
- ``addr`` is now treated like a prefix operator syntactically.
- Added ``global`` pragma that can be used to introduce new global variables
  from within procs.
- ``when`` expressions are now allowed just like ``if`` expressions.
- The precedence for operators starting with ``@`` is different now
  allowing for *sigil-like* operators.
- Stand-alone ``finally`` and ``except`` blocks are now supported.
- Macros and templates can now be invoked as pragmas.
- The apostrophe in type suffixes for numerical literals is now optional.
- Unsigned integer types have been added.
- The integer promotion rules changed.
- Nimrod now tracks proper intervals for ``range`` over some built-in operators.
- In parameter lists a semicolon instead of a comma can be used to improve
  readability: ``proc divmod(a, b: int; resA, resB: var int)``.
- A semicolon can now be used to have multiple simple statements on a single
  line: ``inc i; inc j``.
- ``bind`` supports overloaded symbols and operators.
- A ``distinct`` type can now borrow from generic procs.
- Added the pragmas ``gensym``, ``inject`` and ``dirty`` for hygiene
  in templates.
- Comments can be continued with a backslash continuation character so that
  comment pieces don't have to align on the same column.
- Enums can be annotated with ``pure`` so that their field names do not pollute
  the current scope.
- A proc body can consist of an expression that has a type. This is rewritten
  to ``result = expression`` then.
- Term rewriting macros (see `trmacros <http://nimrod-code.org/trmacros.html>`_)
  have been implemented but are still in alpha.


2012-02-09 Version 0.8.14 released
==================================

Version 0.8.14 has been released!

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed a serious bug concerning different instantiations of a generic proc.
- Fixed a newly introduced bug where a wrong ``EIO`` exception was raised for
  the end of file for text files that do not end with a newline.
- Bugfix c2nim, c2pas: the ``--out`` option has never worked properly.

- Some more bugfixes for macros and compile-time evaluation.
- The GC now takes into account interior pointers on the stack which may be
  introduced by aggressive C optimizers.

Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Removed deprecated ``os.AppendFileExt``, ``os.executeShellCommand``,
  ``os.iterOverEnvironment``, ``os.pcDirectory``, ``os.pcLinkToDirectory``,
  ``os.SplitPath``, ``os.extractDir``, ``os.SplitFilename``,
  ``os.extractFileTrunk``, ``os.extractFileExt``, ``osproc.executeProcess``,
  ``osproc.executeCommand``.
- Removed deprecated ``parseopt.init``, ``parseopt.getRestOfCommandLine``.
- Moved ``strutils.validEmailAddress`` to ``matchers.validEmailAddress``.
- The pointer dereference operator ``^`` has been removed, so that ``^``
  can now be a user-defined operator.
- ``implies`` is no keyword anymore.
- The ``is`` operator is now the ``of`` operator.
- The ``is`` operator is now used to check type equivalence in generic code.
- The ``pure`` pragma for procs has been renamed to ``noStackFrame``.
- The threading API has been completely redesigned.
- The ``unidecode`` module is now thread-safe and its interface has changed.
- The ``bind`` expression is deprecated, use a ``bind`` declaration instead.
- ``system.raiseHook`` is now split into ``system.localRaiseHook`` and
  ``system.globalRaiseHook`` to distinguish between thread local and global
  raise hooks.
- Changed exception handling/error reporting for ``os.removeFile`` and
  ``os.removeDir``.
- The algorithm for searching and loading configuration files has been changed.
- Operators now have diffent precedence rules: Assignment-like operators
  (like ``*=``) are now special-cased.
- The fields in ``TStream`` have been renamed to have an ``Impl`` suffix
  because they should not be used directly anymore.
  Wrapper procs have been created that should be used instead.
- ``export`` is now a keyword.
- ``assert`` is now implemented in pure Nimrod as a template; it's easy
  to implement your own assertion templates with ``system.astToStr``.


Language Additions
------------------

- Added new ``is`` and ``of`` operators.
- The built-in type ``void`` can be used to denote the absence of any type.
  This is useful in generic code.
- Return types may be of the type ``var T`` to return an l-value.
- The error pragma can now be used to mark symbols whose *usage* should trigger
  a compile-time error.
- There is a new ``discardable`` pragma that can be used to mark a routine
  so that its result can be discarded implicitly.
- Added a new ``noinit`` pragma to prevent automatic initialization to zero
  of variables.
- Constants can now have the type ``seq``.
- There is a new user-definable syntactic construct ``a{i, ...}``
  that has no semantics yet for built-in types and so can be overloaded to your
  heart's content.
- ``bind`` (used for symbol binding in templates and generics) is now a
  declarative statement.
- Nimrod now supports single assignment variables via the ``let`` statement.
- Iterators named ``items`` and ``pairs`` are implicitly invoked when
  an explicit iterator is missing.
- The slice assignment ``a[i..j] = b`` where ``a`` is a sequence or string
  now supports *splicing*.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The compiler can generate C++ code for easier interfacing with C++.
- The compiler can generate Objective C code for easier interfacing with
  Objective C.
- The new pragmas ``importcpp`` and ``importobjc`` make interfacing with C++
  and Objective C somewhat easier.
- Added a new pragma ``incompleteStruct`` to deal with incomplete C struct
  definitions.
- Added a ``--nimcache:PATH`` configuration option for control over the output
  directory for generated code.
- The ``--genScript`` option now produces different compilation scripts
  which do not contain absolute paths.
- Added ``--cincludes:dir``, ``--clibdir:lib`` configuration options for
  modifying the C compiler's header/library search path in cross-platform way.
- Added ``--clib:lib`` configuration option for specifying additional
  C libraries to be linked.
- Added ``--mainmodule:file`` configuration options for specifying the main
  project file. This is intended to be used in project configuration files to
  allow commands like ``nimrod c`` or ``nimrod check`` to be executed anywhere
  within the project's directory structure.
- Added a ``--app:staticlib`` option for creating static libraries.
- Added a ``--tlsEmulation:on|off`` switch for control over thread local
  storage emulation.
- The compiler and standard library now support a *taint mode*. Input strings
  are declared with the ``TaintedString`` string type. If the taint
  mode is turned on it is a distinct string type which helps to detect input
  validation errors.
- The compiler now supports the compilation cache via ``--symbolFiles:on``.
  This potentially speeds up compilations by an order of magnitude, but is
  still highly experimental!
- Added ``--import:file`` and ``--include:file`` configuration options
  for specifying modules that will be automatically imported/incluced.
- ``nimrod i`` can now optionally be given a module to execute.
- The compiler now performs a simple alias analysis to generate better code.
- The compiler and ENDB now support *watchpoints*.
- The compiler now supports proper compile time expressions of type ``bool``
  for ``on|off`` switches in pragmas. In order to not break existing code,
  ``on`` and ``off`` are now aliases for ``true`` and ``false`` and declared
  in the system module.
- The compiler finally supports **closures**. This is a preliminary
  implementation, which does not yet support nestings deeper than 1 level
  and still has many known bugs.


Library Additions
-----------------

- Added ``system.allocShared``, ``system.allocShared0``,
  ``system.deallocShared``, ``system.reallocShared``.
- Slicing as implemented by the system module now supports *splicing*.
- Added explicit channels for thread communication.
- Added ``matchers`` module for email address etc. matching.

2011-07-10 Version 0.8.12 released
==================================

Bugfixes
--------

- Bugfix: ``httpclient`` correct passes the path starting with ``/``.
- Bugfixes for the ``htmlparser`` module.
- Bugfix: ``pegs.find`` did not respect ``start`` parameter.
- Bugfix: ``dialogs.ChooseFilesToOpen`` did not work if only one file is
  selected.
- Bugfix: niminst: ``nimrod`` is not default dir for *every* project.
- Bugfix: Multiple yield statements in iterators did not cause local vars to be
  copied.
- Bugfix: The compiler does not emit very inaccurate floating point literals
  anymore.
- Bugfix: Subclasses are taken into account for ``try except`` matching.
- Bugfix: Generics and macros are more stable. There are still known bugs left
  though.
- Bugfix: Generated type information for tuples was sometimes wrong, causing
  random crashes.
- Lots of other bugfixes: Too many to list them all.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Operators starting with ``^`` are now right-associative and have the highest
  priority.
- Deprecated ``os.getApplicationFilename``: Use ``os.getAppFilename`` instead.
- Deprecated ``os.getApplicationDir``: Use ``os.getAppDir`` instead.
- Deprecated ``system.copy``: Use ``substr`` or string slicing instead.
- Changed and documented how generalized string literals work: The syntax
  ``module.re"abc"`` is now supported.
- Changed the behaviour of ``strutils.%``, ``ropes.%``
  if both notations ``$#`` and ``$i`` are involved.
- The ``pegs`` and ``re`` modules distinguish between ``replace``
  and ``replacef`` operations.
- The pointer dereference operation ``p^`` is deprecated and might become
  ``^p`` in later versions or be dropped entirely since it is rarely used.
  Use the new notation ``p[]`` in the rare cases where you need to
  dereference a pointer explicitly.
- ``system.readFile`` does not return ``nil`` anymore but raises an ``EIO``
  exception instead.
- Unsound co-/contravariance for procvars has been removed.


Language Additions
------------------

- Source code filters are now documented.
- Added the ``linearScanEnd``, ``unroll``, ``shallow`` pragmas.
- Added ``emit`` pragma for direct code generator control.
- Case statement branches support constant sets for programming convenience.
- Tuple unpacking is not enforced in ``for`` loops anymore.
- The compiler now supports array, sequence and string slicing.
- A field in an ``enum`` may be given an explicit string representation.
  This yields more maintainable code than using a constant
  ``array[TMyEnum, string]`` mapping.
- Indices in array literals may be explicitly given, enhancing readability:
  ``[enumValueA: "a", enumValueB: "b"]``.
- Added thread support via the ``threads`` core module and
  the ``--threads:on`` command line switch.
- The built-in iterators ``system.fields`` and ``system.fieldPairs`` can be
  used to iterate over any field of a tuple. With this mechanism operations
  like ``==`` and ``hash`` are lifted to tuples.
- The slice ``..`` is now a first-class operator, allowing code like:
  ``x in 1000..100_000``.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The compiler supports IDEs via the new group of ``idetools`` command line
  options.
- The *interactive mode* (REPL) has been improved and documented for the
  first time.
- The compiler now might use hashing for string case statements depending
  on the number of string literals in the case statement.


Library Additions
-----------------

- Added ``lists`` module which contains generic linked lists.
- Added ``sets`` module which contains generic hash sets.
- Added ``tables`` module which contains generic hash tables.
- Added ``queues`` module which contains generic sequence based queues.
- Added ``intsets`` module which contains a specialized int set data type.
- Added ``scgi`` module.
- Added ``smtp`` module.
- Added ``encodings`` module.
- Added ``re.findAll``, ``pegs.findAll``.
- Added ``os.findExe``.
- Added ``parseutils.parseUntil`` and ``parseutils.parseWhile``.
- Added ``strutils.align``, ``strutils.tokenize``, ``strutils.wordWrap``.
- Pegs support a *captured search loop operator* ``{@}``.
- Pegs support new built-ins: ``\letter``, ``\upper``, ``\lower``,
  ``\title``, ``\white``.
- Pegs support the new built-in ``\skip`` operation.
- Pegs support the ``$`` and ``^`` anchors.
- Additional operations were added to the ``complex`` module.
- Added ``strutils.formatFloat``,  ``strutils.formatBiggestFloat``.
- Added unary ``<`` for nice looking excluding upper bounds in ranges.
- Added ``math.floor``.
- Added ``system.reset`` and a version of ``system.open`` that
  returns a ``TFile`` and raises an exception in case of an error.
- Added a wrapper for ``redis``.
- Added a wrapper for ``0mq`` via the ``zmq`` module.
- Added a wrapper for ``sphinx``.
- Added ``system.newStringOfCap``.
- Added ``system.raiseHook`` and ``system.outOfMemHook``.
- Added ``system.writeFile``.
- Added ``system.shallowCopy``.
- ``system.echo`` is guaranteed to be thread-safe.
- Added ``prelude`` include file for scripting convenience.
- Added ``typeinfo`` core module for access to runtime type information.
- Added ``marshal`` module for JSON serialization.


2010-10-20 Version 0.8.10 released
==================================

Bugfixes
--------

- Bugfix: Command line parsing on Windows and ``os.parseCmdLine`` now adheres
  to the same parsing rules as Microsoft's C/C++ startup code.
- Bugfix: Passing a ``ref`` pointer to the untyped ``pointer`` type is invalid.
- Bugfix: Updated ``keyval`` example.
- Bugfix: ``system.splitChunk`` still contained code for debug output.
- Bugfix: ``dialogs.ChooseFileToSave`` uses ``STOCK_SAVE`` instead of
  ``STOCK_OPEN`` for the GTK backend.
- Bugfix: Various bugs concerning exception handling fixed.
- Bugfix: ``low(somestring)`` crashed the compiler.
- Bugfix: ``strutils.endsWith`` lacked range checking.
- Bugfix: Better detection for AMD64 on Mac OS X.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Reversed parameter order for ``os.copyFile`` and ``os.moveFile``!!!
- Procs not marked as ``procvar`` cannot only be passed to a procvar anymore,
  unless they are used in the same module.
- Deprecated ``times.getStartMilsecs``: Use ``epochTime`` or ``cpuTime``
  instead.
- Removed ``system.OpenFile``.
- Removed ``system.CloseFile``.
- Removed ``strutils.replaceStr``.
- Removed ``strutils.deleteStr``.
- Removed ``strutils.splitLinesSeq``.
- Removed ``strutils.splitSeq``.
- Removed ``strutils.toString``.
- If a DLL cannot be loaded (via the ``dynlib`` pragma) ``EInvalidLibrary``
  is not raised anymore. Instead ``system.quit()`` is called. This is because
  raising an exception requires heap allocations. However the memory manager
  might be contained in the DLL that failed to load.
- The ``re`` module (and the ``pcre`` wrapper) now depend on the pcre dll.


Additions
---------

- The ``{.compile: "file.c".}`` pragma uses a CRC check to see if the file
  needs to be recompiled.
- Added ``system.reopen``.
- Added ``system.getCurrentException``.
- Added ``system.appType``.
- Added ``system.compileOption``.
- Added ``times.epochTime`` and ``times.cpuTime``.
- Implemented explicit type arguments for generics.
- Implemented ``{.size: sizeof(cint).}`` pragma for enum types. This is useful
  for interfacing with C.
- Implemented ``{.pragma.}`` pragma for user defined pragmas.
- Implemented ``{.extern.}`` pragma for better control of name mangling.
- The ``importc`` and ``exportc`` pragmas support format strings:
  ``proc p{.exportc: "nim_$1".}`` exports ``p`` as ``nim_p``. This is useful
  for user defined pragmas.
- The standard library can be built as a DLL. Generating DLLs has been
  improved.
- Added ``expat`` module.
- Added ``json`` module.
- Added support for a *Tiny C* backend. Currently this only works on Linux.
  You need to bootstrap with ``-d:tinyc`` to enable Tiny C support. Nimrod
  can then execute code directly via ``nimrod run myfile``.


2010-03-14 Version 0.8.8 released
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
- The Posix version of ``os.copyFile`` has better error handling.
- Fixed bug #502670 (underscores in identifiers).
- Fixed a bug in the ``parsexml`` module concerning the parsing of
  ``<tag attr="value" />``.
- Fixed a bug in the ``parsexml`` module concerning the parsing of
  enities like ``&ltXX``.
- ``system.write(f: TFile, s: string)`` now works even if ``s`` contains binary
  zeros.
- Fixed a bug in ``os.setFilePermissions`` for Windows.
- An overloadable symbol can now have the same name as an imported module.
- Fixed a serious bug in ``strutils.cmpIgnoreCase``.
- Fixed ``unicode.toUTF8``.
- The compiler now rejects ``'\n'`` (use ``"\n"`` instead).
- ``times.getStartMilsecs()`` now works on Mac OS X.
- Fixed a bug in ``pegs.match`` concerning start offsets.
- Lots of other little bugfixes.


Additions
---------
- Added ``system.cstringArrayToSeq``.
- Added ``system.lines(f: TFile)`` iterator.
- Added ``system.delete``, ``system.del`` and ``system.insert`` for sequences.
- Added ``system./`` for int.
- Exported ``system.newException`` template.
- Added ``cgi.decodeData(data: string): tuple[key, value: string]``.
- Added ``strutils.insertSep``.
- Added ``math.trunc``.
- Added ``ropes`` module.
- Added ``sockets`` module.
- Added ``browsers`` module.
- Added ``httpserver`` module.
- Added ``httpclient`` module.
- Added ``parseutils`` module.
- Added ``unidecode`` module.
- Added ``xmldom`` module.
- Added ``xmldomparser`` module.
- Added ``xmltree`` module.
- Added ``xmlparser`` module.
- Added ``htmlparser`` module.
- Added ``re`` module.
- Added ``graphics`` module.
- Added ``colors`` module.
- Many wrappers now do not contain redundant name prefixes (like ``GTK_``,
  ``lua``). The old wrappers are still available in ``lib/oldwrappers``.
  You can change your configuration file to use these.
- Triple quoted strings allow for ``"`` in more contexts.
- ``""`` within raw string literals stands for a single quotation mark.
- Arguments to ``openArray`` parameters can be left out.
- More extensive subscript operator overloading. (To be documented.)
- The documentation generator supports the ``.. raw:: html`` directive.
- The Pegs module supports back references via the notation ``$capture_index``.


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------

- Overloading of the subscript operator only works if the type does not provide
  a built-in one.
- The search order for libraries which is affected by the ``path`` option
  has been reversed, so that the project's path is searched before
  the standard library's path.
- The compiler does not include a Pascal parser for bootstrapping purposes any
  more. Instead there is a ``pas2nim`` tool that contains the old functionality.
- The procs ``os.copyFile`` and ``os.moveFile`` have been deprecated
  temporarily, so that the compiler warns about their usage. Use them with
  named arguments only, because the parameter order will change the next
  version!
- ``atomic`` and ``let`` are now keywords.
- The ``\w`` character class for pegs now includes the digits ``'0'..'9'``.
- Many wrappers now do not contain redundant name prefixes (like ``GTK_``,
  ``lua``) anymore.
- Arguments to ``openArray`` parameters can be left out.


2009-12-21 Version 0.8.6 released
=================================

The version jump from 0.8.2 to 0.8.6 acknowledges the fact that all development
of the compiler is now done in Nimrod.


Bugfixes
--------
- The pragmas ``hint[X]:off`` and ``warning[X]:off`` now work.
- Method call syntax for iterators works again (``for x in lines.split()``).
- Fixed a typo in ``removeDir`` for POSIX that lead to an infinite recursion.
- The compiler now checks that module filenames are valid identifiers.
- Empty patterns for the ``dynlib`` pragma are now possible.
- ``os.parseCmdLine`` returned wrong results for trailing whitespace.
- Inconsequent tuple usage (using the same tuple with and without named fields)
  does not crash the code generator anymore.
- A better error message is provided when the loading of a proc within a
  dynamic lib fails.


Additions
---------
- Added ``system.contains`` for open arrays.
- The PEG module now supports the *search loop operator* ``@``.
- Grammar/parser: ``SAD|IND`` is allowed before any kind of closing bracket.
  This allows for more flexible source code formating.
- The compiler now uses a *bind* table for symbol lookup within a ``bind``
  context. (See `<manual.html#templates>`_ for details.)
- ``discard """my long comment"""`` is now optimized away.
- New ``--floatChecks: on|off`` switches and pragmas for better debugging
  of floating point operations. (See
  `<manual.html#pre-defined-floating-point-types>`_ for details.)
- The manual has been improved. (Many thanks to Philippe Lhoste!)


Changes affecting backwards compatibility
-----------------------------------------
- The compiler does not skip the linking step anymore even if no file
  has changed.
- ``os.splitFile(".xyz")`` now returns ``("", ".xyz", "")`` instead of
  ``("", "", ".xyz")``. So filenames starting with a dot are handled
  differently.
- ``strutils.split(s: string, seps: set[char])`` never yields the empty string
  anymore. This behaviour is probably more appropriate for whitespace splitting.
- The compiler now stops after the ``--version`` command line switch.
- Removed support for enum inheritance in the parser; enum inheritance has
  never been documented anyway.
- The ``msg`` field of ``system.E_base`` has now the type ``string``, instead
  of ``cstring``. This improves memory safety.
